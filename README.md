#Running the Project

1. **Change Directory:**

Navigate to the project folder:

cd redesign-nubank

2. **Start the Server:**

Open the project in VSCode.

Right-click on the index.html file and choose "Open with Live Server".

This will open the project in your default browser using a local server, allowing the SVGInject functionality to work properly.

3. **Exploring the Project:**

Once the server is started, you can navigate through the project and interact with its different elements.

Make sure Live Server is running whenever you're working on the project.
